                        <p>Hi, my name is PJ.  I am a student who is currently attending NYIT. I am in my senior year of Electrical and Computer Engineering but  <br> but I also have a passion for programming.  Below is a brief description of myself as well as my portfolio for the software industry.

                        <p>I am very much interested in working with microprocessors and microcontrollers and the programming that is associated with them.  </p>
                        <p>I am looking for an internship that will apply the knowledge and skills that I have learned in college and come up with practical solutions to real-life problems.  I have a wide array of skills ranging from designing electrical and computer systems using microcontrollers and microprocessors to programming and software engineering.  My goals in the industry is to become better acquainted with all sorts of electrical and computer equipment and/or become a much more experienced programmer.  
In my previous internship, I have audited residential and commercial facilities on their energy usage.  I made sure that they were using energy efficient electronic systems and HVAC systems and were in compliance with local energy laws.  I provided optimal energy-saving solutions to obsolete systems of their infrastructure.     
My skills include designing digital circuitry using circuit simulation software such as pSpice and Electronics Workbench.  I have experience with programing in hardware description language such as Verilog and VHDL.  I have worked with Arduino family and MSP430 microcontrollers and C code associated with them.  I also have experience with the following programming languages; C, C++, Java, Javascript, Python, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and .PHP.
